Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.


Fortunately, Jill caught him with her quick reactions.

Unfortunately, when Jack reached the top of the hill, there was a raging mustafarian waiting for him.


Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
